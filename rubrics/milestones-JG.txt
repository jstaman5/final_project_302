Report:
	
	Because learning a new language was necessary for part of this project,
a majority of my time was used to familiarize myself with the dos and the 
don'ts of Python. I belive it will be beneficial for our group to utilize 
this language, as it simplifies the complexity of deciding and planning out 
our data structure. 
	At the moment, our main focus is deciding how exactly we'd like to
implement our functions and how to split up the work. We've deliberated a
couple of methods of storing our data, but I think the best way for us to
set up our structure is one that matches our end-goal for this project:
machine learning.
	 After our group meeting we decided exactly how we'd continue with
implementing our cube class: using simple arrays. We also decided on how 
exactly we are going to split up the work for the next portion of our
project. We will be working on the functions for implementation, the file
structure that our system will utilize, and the user interface that our
project will implement.
