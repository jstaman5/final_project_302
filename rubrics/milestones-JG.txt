Report:
	
	Because learning a new language was necessary for part of this project,
a majority of my time was used to familiarize myself with the dos and the 
don'ts of Python. I belive it will be beneficial for our group to utilize 
this language, as it simplifies the complexity of deciding and planning out 
our data structure. 
	At the moment, our main focus is deciding how exactly we'd like to
implement our functions and how to split up the work. We've gone through a
couple of methods of storing our data, but I think the best way for us to
set up our structure is one that matches our end-goal for this project:
machine learning.
	 After our group meeting...
