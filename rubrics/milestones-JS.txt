mini-challenge 7: 40 points

10pts: research 3-D representation of rubik's cube

10pts: continue learning/researching python

10pts: determine what data structure(s) we want to use

10pts: write a simple python program


Jared Staman time log:

2 hours in lab on Monday - planned how we want to represent the cube, what functions we will need (we are going to have 6 arrays, one for each face, to represent cube)

1 hour 5-6pm on Tuesday - watched a couple python tutorials on youtube

2 hours 6-8pm on Wednesday - messed around in python for a bit, learning how to iterate through arrays and such

2 hour 7-8pm on Thursday - read some stuff on some python, more videos, wrote practice program


Summary and next steps: 

This challenge was helpful since it forced me to get a start on learning some python before we get into the actual coding part of our project. We also spent a lot of the past week
debating how we want to represent the rubik's cube, and I'm glad that is resolved. We have also split the upcoming work between each other: functions, constructor, file management, user-side stuff, etc.
We hope to have something that is able to be interacted with a user in a couple of weeks.
